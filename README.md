# Statistical-project-NBA-Season-2015-2016


Statistics of all kinds abound in basketball, making it a very ideal topic to discuss in a statistics work. The choice of the NBA is because it is the most attractive league when it comes to obtaining data. This is where the best players from around the world play and focuses on talent. An example is historical performances where players have scored 100 points, given 30 assists or grabbed 42 rebounds. Of players who average triple-doubles per season or even those who have managed to reach a quadruple-double in a game.

**NOTE**: A triple-double is achieving double digits in at least three of the traditional quantifiable statistical data. These are points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. A quadruple-double is the same thing but in four statistical data.
